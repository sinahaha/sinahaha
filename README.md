- 👋 Hi, I’m Sina, a professional computer specialist and a junior guitar player.
- 👀 I’m interested in many things! English language and literature, guitar, drums, metal work, astrophotography, camping, whiskey, cars, food and a lot of things!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Spring Boot. It is amazingly amazing, yet quite a challenge.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on cloud native projects.
- 📫 Just drop a mail to: sina.hapi@gmail.com.
